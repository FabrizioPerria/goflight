 - Example of go backend application implementing REST api.
 - Uses MongoDB to store data.
 - Mongodb is deployed along with replicas via docker compose.
 - Makefile to simplify operations.
 - I use both a unit test infrastructure and a rest file to run manual checks during development.
 - use an env file to setup the environment
